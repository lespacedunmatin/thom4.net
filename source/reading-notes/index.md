I use books as a **learning material**.
This space is an attempt to share my margin notes to reflect on what I read by writing.
For you, it's an opportunity to sneak peak at great books without having to read them entirely.

I currently read about **group dynamics**, **sex/masculinity** and **local history**.
Poke me with your recommendations!
