title: Reading Notes

I use books as **resources for personal development**. This space is an attempt to share my margin notes to learn as well, and also to have a sneak peak at great books without having to read them entirely.

My current focus is on **communities/identities** and **toxic masculinities**. Poke me with your recommendations!
