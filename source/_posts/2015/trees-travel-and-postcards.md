I liked to send you postcards. To make them. And to send you printed photographs as well.

I am glad a printed *fraction of time* can provide a glimpse of a presence.

(*long breathe*)

I remember when I was a *kid* — probably around 8 or 9 years old — I happened to sit in a *church* for the funerals of an *old lady*.

This day, I did not *cry*. And I did not cry because when I was a kid, I thought it was normal to die when you get old enough.

Since then, I grew up and I must acknowledge I learned something valuable since. I learned it was normal to be sad. That it was normal to cry. And that **it was normal to cry when you are sad**.

Even when you are a *boy*.
Even when you are an *adult*.
Even when you are an *adult boy*.

Today I feel like a *boy* again.
Today we are in a *church* again.
And **I am happy I am able to *cry*** — this time.

You loved to receive postcards and photographs. You said it was a way for you to travel from your couch. You were delighted by my *creativity*. Ever since I was a *kid*.

This is what I would like *us* to remember. The **trees** and the **green landscapes** you liked to be *surrounded* by. The **postcards** you liked to *receive*.

I will *continue* to send you *postcards*.

Farewell grandma. **I wish graves had a letterbox**.
