[LXJS 2013](http://2013.lxjs.org) is the second edition of English conference located in Lisbon, Portugal. LXJS is an *all-inclusive single track JavaScript* conference spanned on two days.

To keep things short, this wrap up will be a **one sentence summary per *enlightening* session**.

<!--more-->

Coincidentely, this milestone was my second JavaScript-only conference *and* my second journey in Lisbon (especially I never came back twice to the same place on my own).

Many people around me left LXJS with a huge smile on their face. And I must admit this edition is a huge success: at **curating good speakers**, at **widening our spectrum of knowledge** and most importantly, at providing an **opportunity to meet genuine people** among the attendees.

## [Jed Schmidt](http://jed.is/)

He compares his main area of expertise (translating) with his late learning field (JavaScript programming) through the concept of [linguistic relativity](https://vimeo.com/42744105).

As a side note, I’m happy to have met him, as I've authored a [Chrome Packager Grunt task](https://github.com/thom4parisot/grunt-crx) based on his [npm module crx](https://github.com/jed/crx).

## [Robert Nyman](http://robertnyman.com/)

[Web Intents](http://webintents.org/) is about to resurrect as [Web Activities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Web_Activities), and this is a good news.

## [Estelle Weyl](http://www.standardista.com/)

She showcased an interesting responsive image technique based on SVG: the [Clown Car technique](http://www.standardista.com/responsive-images-clown-car-technique/).

## [Jonathan Lipps](http://jonathanlipps.com/)

[Appium](http://appium.io/) is an Open Source device and browser simulator to run tests on real devices and virtual devices, both locally and remotely (via your own infrastructure or via Saucelabs).

## [Martin Naumann](http://ox86.tumblr.com/)

The Second Screen W3C Working Group freshly emerged to propose a RemoteDOM spec, aiming at creating a standard for a Browser-based second screen API.

**Nota Bene**: this is a current field of work in our BBC R&D team.

## [Tim Park](https://github.com/timfpark)

He showcased [Nitrogen](https://github.com/nitrogenjs) as his attempt to combine security, authentication and internet exposed home devices.

 **Nota Bene**: this is a current field of work in our BBC R&D team.

## [Rod Vagg](http://r.va.gg/)

I liked the idea of LevelDB as a composable database framework, backend and infrastructure layers; and realised I always mingled IndexedDB with LevelDB.

## [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com/)

A clear explanation of [Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt), [Merkle Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and [Cypherlinks](https://github.com/dominictarr/cyphernet) to illustrate that the scalability is the expression of performance changes as the size (of code, nodes and/or data) increases.

## [Mike Brevoort](http://about.me/mbrevoort)

How [Thalassa](https://github.com/PearsonEducation/thalassa) helped a slow-paced release company to become a champion in software Continuous Deployment; based on HA Proxy and Node.js.

## [Ivan Babrou](http://bobrik.name)

How they leveraged Nginx with its cache and image resizing features to scale millions of pictures in a dozen of sizes and aspect ratio.

## [Michal Budzynski](http://michalbe.blogspot.co.uk/)

[Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/API/Gamepad/Using_Gamepad_API) is the worst designed HTML5 API; when it’s implemented.

## [Mark Boas](http://happyworm.com/)

[Hyperaudio](http://hyperaud.io/) is part of his quest to leverage the [MediaFragment API](http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/) as a way to remix and share audio/video subtitled contents in an easy way.

**Nota Bene**: this is a current field of work in our BBC R&D team.

## [Angelina Fabbro](http://realityhacking.net/) + [Bill Mills](http://physicsvancouver.com/)

[interdisciplinaryprogramming.com](http://interdisciplinaryprogramming.com/) is the crossroads of the strong academic knowledge (and poor UI/programming skills) and the practical-minded world of Web developers: “Sometimes you just don’t know better.”

## [Aral Balkan](http://aralbalkan.com/)

The concept of Continuous Client: cloud, hardware, software services and you (through the ID).

**Nota Bene**: i don’t understand this praise of building another-other smartphone hardware and OS ([codenamed Prometheus](http://codename-prometheus.eu/)) instead of improving [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/) and [Fairphone](http://www.fairphone.com/).

## [Dustin Diaz](http://dustindiaz.com/)

“Don’t let your employer/company defining who you are.”

{% youtube nVuKc5lZJps %}

**Remark**: whereas the slideless format could have been disturbing for some folks, this sole sentence is the best piece of wisdom from LXJS. Yet we want to improve our skills and practice, our professional/personal environments are the ones helping us to ~feel~ be happy.

## [Vyacheslav Egorov](http://mrale.ph/)

Insightful JavaScript VM internals about constant propagation and loop invariant code motion; or [why some JSPerf benchmarks are biased](http://mrale.ph/blog/2013/08/14/hidden-classes-vs-jsperf.html) by differences among VM optimisations.

## [Bert Belder](http://strongloop.com/)

How eventually the [Node.js Task API](https://github.com/nujs/nu) will be an easier and more natural guard to implement rather than the cumbersome Domain one.

**Nota Bene**: on a side note, it is also interesting to compare our startup experiences and noticing there is no much difference in raising a demi-million or several millions of cash to create a product: features don’t bring customers nor money.

## [James Halliday](http://substack.net/)

“Everything on npm”: from Node.js modules to C (with [dotc](https://github.com/substack/dotc)) while also considering frontend components.

**Nota Bene**: i wish the *node_modules* folder to be renamed as *npm_modules* to fix our mind conception about npm.

## [Domenic Denicola](http://domenic.me/)

The best “contribute to the Web” talk so far:
- lurking first
- solution time comes later
- understanding the constraints
- build small coalitions
- be present
- (and mute endless conversations leading to nowhere)

## Thank You as a gift

[I initiated a ritual at Reasons to Be Creative](/2013/they-gave-me-reasons-to-be-creative/), by **offering an instant picture of inspiring people**, a portrait of themselves, speaker or not speaker.
A **give away on any kind of ownership** of the picture, expressing my thankfulness and letting them know this gesture.

As there were really too many people to thank for, I randomly decided to attribute the picture to [David Dias](https://twitter.com/daviddias), one of the organiser of the conference.

A sort of reward as **I really feel enthusiastic thanks to LXJS**. Especially as it gave me to think about using `npm` over `bower` for frontend package management. I’ll write more about this later, the time to experiment and continue this discussion with some other folks.

## What’s next?

**I’ll definitely attend LXJS in 2014**. And submit a topic or two, especially as 20 minutes is a really good format (oh yes, I think I did not get bored even if I was less interested by some talks — which is a good point).

I was glad to meet a couple of new faces, like [Karolis](http://kn8.lt/), [Vyacheslav](http://mrale.ph/) (thanks to a retweet ;-)) and [Jan](http://janmonschke.com/).

Finally, here are some hints to provide an even better LXJS 2014:
- **being on time** (especially for the breaks otherwise we are starving)
- **caring about the duration**: 6h of sessions in an afternoon — for a second day, after two parties — is a lot to handle
- **more time for the lunchbreak** (1h is really too short, to eat and to talk)
- being clear on the availability of a breakfast or not
- a small detail but I had to throw 90% of the goodies except the T-shirt and a couple of stickers, because the rest was redundant (and was not fitting in my travel bag)

Oh and yes, [the videos of LXJS 2013 are already available](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiCGpqnkj9oRzPsJBql7pGw)!
